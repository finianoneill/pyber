Seeing the success of notable players like Uber and Lyft, I've decided to create a fledgling (fictional!) ride sharing company of my own. I'll be acting as Chief Data Strategist and CEO for the company.

I've been given access to the company's complete recordset of rides (fictional dataset contained within this repository). This contains information about every active driver and historic ride, including details like city, driver count, individual fares, and city type.

As Chief Data Strategist, I have built a [Bubble Plot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_chart) that showcases the relationship between four key variables:

* Average Fare ($) Per City
* Total Number of Rides Per City
* Total Number of Drivers Per City
* City Type (Urban, Suburban, Rural)

Moreover, I have also built into the Jupyter Notebook the following three pie charts:

* % of Total Fares by City Type
* % of Total Rides by City Type
* % of Total Drivers by City Type

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

The only thing necessary to run this project is a working version of Python and Jupyter Notebook. I suggest downloading [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos).
